## Getting Started

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the learn course.

The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Next.js.

If you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

### System Requirements

- [Node.js 12.22.0](https://nodejs.org/) or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

## Automatic Setup

We recommend creating a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
```
